# Line of Sight (LOS) Module

This module provides functionality to calculate and visualize the line of sight between two points.

The exact logic and frameworks used are still to be determined, but the core features will include:

1. Use of Copernicus DEM data
2. Calculation of line of sight between two geographic coordinates
3. Production of an raw output that can be later visualized in the main app

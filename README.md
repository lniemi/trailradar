# Sport Radar

Application for spectating ultra-trail events in real-time. The app displays the location of participants on a map. Spectators can follow specific participants and receive information about their progress. Spectators can also view the event along the route physically and with the help of augmented reality (AR) technology they can orientate themselves and find participants nearby.

****
Media coverage is difficult, expensive, and not possible for every event, especially those in remote regions. This can cause fan disengagement as fans are unable to experience it live.

Our app allows users to follow a race and virtually recreate it. By using simple traking and satellite data, we are able to realistically simulate the race. Users can also customize their view by focusing on any specific athlete.

Key Features:

*   **Map View**: A virtual recreation of the race.
*   **User Focus**: In traditional coverage, only certain athletes are focused on. Our app allows you to change which athlete you focus on.
*   **Live Comments**: Live comments are also supported, allowing for a Twitch-like experience as viewers can cheer on their favourate athletes
*   **Weather simulation**: Simulation includes weather effects for added immersion 
*   **Easy setup**: Setting up only requires us to know the athlestes current position
